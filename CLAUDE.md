# Project convention
For code that uses cute-dsl (as part of function decorated with cute.jit or
cute.kernel), only a subset of Python syntax is supported.
Follow [Control Flow](docs/dsl_control_flow.rst) and [Limitations](docs/limitations.rst).
# Code style
- Favor concise, self-explanatory code
- Avoid unnecessary comments
- Avoid unnecessary line breaks
- Empty lines should not have any space
